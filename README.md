# odu_cs823_prject_1A
This project is to write code for seq_alignment and best score for protein sequences provided sequences, match, mismatch and gap scores.

I have written two different programmes:
1. First program (seq_alignment.py)takes s1, s2, pam250, gap as arguements and prints out alignment seq1, seq2, and best_score.
2. Second program (simple_alignment_Project_1A.py) takes s1, s2, match, mismatch, gap and prints out alignent seq1, seq2 and best_score.

Arguements are set to defalult. Arguements can be changed at the top of program file and run to implement the program.
